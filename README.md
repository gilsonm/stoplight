A safe forum for whistleblowers to expose gaslighting campaigns in schools, organizations, and communities.

Gaslighting is a form of communal intolerance and abuse against segrated individuals. 

While the reasons for such coordinated hatred and abuse are manifold and nothing new in the course of human history, the rising popularity of this method of attack is due to its effectiveness and zero risk for attackers. The ability to coordinate such a campaign is made exceedingly simple given our connected society, where each individual carries a smart phone attached to social media. It is these communication channels that enable the attack to take place as well as providing a secure means to withold the evidence of the campgain from any would-be whistle-blowers or legal analysis.

The effects of gaslighting on targeted individuals are massive. And the goal of gaslighting is to damage the target in a manner consistent with either 

1) fictitious stories propagating through the community via the social media private channels, to make the damage look like the obvious result of some decoy, constructed state of affairs or
2) some vulnerability in the target is exercised so to concentrate blame on the target.

Gaslighting makes use of the hierarchy in the school, organization, and community. 

Abusers are either adjacent or above the targeted individual, such that any whistleblowing will grind up against the order of individuals, and thereby create great risk for the targeted, and likely endure additional damage for speaking about the hierarchy.

My only idea so far, is for targets to amass evidence using the same social media that is being used against them. And to connect people within the community to possibly find allies, so that the campaign can be terminated.
